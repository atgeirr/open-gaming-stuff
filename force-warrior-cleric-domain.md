Bonus Proficiencies

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with
all martial weapons.

Instinctive defense
--------------

From 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a
shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom
modifier.  Alternatively, while you are wearing light armor or under
the protection of the *mage armor* spell, you can add your Wisdom
modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier to your AC.

Channel Divinity: Instinctive Strike
---------------------------

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to assault
enemies with your innate force abilities.

When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to
gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the
roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

Warrior of the Force
----------------

Starting at 6th level, your mastery of the force grants you special abilities.

 * You gain resistance to force damage.
 * You gain blindsight with 10' radius.
 * You gain a bonus to initiative checks equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Force Strike
----------

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with
the power of the force. Once on each of your turns when you hit a
creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an
extra 1d8 force damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the
extra damage increases to 2d8.

One with the force
---------------

At 17th level, you achieve perfect unity with the force, allowing you
to further defend yourself against assaults from within and without.

 * You gain immunity to psychic and force damage.
 * As a reaction, when you are targeted by a weapon attack, you can
   impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

When you die, you can choose to remain in the world as a force ghost.
