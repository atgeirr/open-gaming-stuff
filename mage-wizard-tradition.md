============
Level 2: Arcane prodigy. Learn one additional spell per level starting with level 2, to add to your spell book. The three spells you learn must come from at least two different schools.

Too strong: all different schools,
Ritual prodigy: Third must be ritual (supported by others).
Too good.
Arcana expertise
Should rather reward adventuring for spells.
Reduce gold and time you spend to copy a spell to your spellbook by 25% for all spells.

============
Level 2: Prodigious memory. Add your proficiency bonus to the number of wizard spells you can prepare.

Nice but overpowered?
Bad to scale with proficiency bonus?
Good enough to have this as only level 2 feature.
Split between extra cantrips and spells.

============
Level 6: Flexible recovery. When you use your Arcane Recovery, instead of regaining spell slots you can choose to replace a number of prepared spells with different spells from your spellbook, equal to half your wizard level, rounded up.

Not enough flavor.
Fast rituals: cast rituals in five rounds (half a minute) instead of 10 minutes.
Adaptive recovery. Exchange in addition to recover.
Elemental mastery: change damage type of spell.

============
Level 10: Extra recovery. You can use the Arcane Recovery ability twice per long rest instead of once. You can still only use it once per short rest, to use it again you must take a second short rest.

KISS: why not just say "once per short rest".
May prepare spells during a short rest.
Impose disadvantage on save once per short rest or INT/long rest.

============
Level 14: Metamagic. You gain 5 sorcery points and a metamagic ability of your choice. The sorcery points gained can be used for metamagic abilities, but this feature does not grant you the ability to exchange sorcery points for spell slots or the reverse (you can exchange them if you have the ability from a different class).

Infringes on sorcerer.
Instead: any spell with a duration of 10 minutes or more gains the "Ritual" tag.
If metamagic, once per short rest, but rather something unique.
Improving prodigous memory?
Piercing spell: Once per short rest add prof bonus, ignore resistance etc.

========================

Instant preparation. Tome of readiness.
Extra cantrips. Prestidigitation?
Counterspelling and dispelling.
Retain rituals w/o spellbook.
Improved concentration: concentrate on 2 spells (no!), super specialized in single conc. spell (un-generalist)




========================
========================

I have now revised my original proposal.

I have heeded the advice that metamagic should be reserved for sorcerers,
and that the level 2 abilities were a bit overpowered. I have decided not to
mess with concentration, and while making better use of rituals seems
tempting, I think that is a good idea for a separate tradition/subclass, and
do not include those features here.

Note that I have renamed some of the abilities compared to the original text.


Wizard tradition: Mage
==============

Level 2: Arcane Prodigy. Learn one additional cantrip.
Level 2: Prodigous Memory. Add 2 to the number of wizard spells you can prepare.

Level 6: Adaptive Recovery. When you use your Arcane Recovery, in
addition to regaining spell slots you can choose to replace a number
of prepared spells with different spells from your spellbook. The
number of spells you can replace is equal to one-third your wizard
level, rounded down.

Level 10: Improved Arcane Prodigy: Learn one additional cantrip.
Level 10: Improved Prodigous Memory. Add 2 to the number of wizard
spells you can prepare. This is cumulative with prodigous memory for a total
of 4 extra prepared spells.

Level 14: Archmage. You gain the following abilities:
  * You may cast any spell in your spellbook even if you have not
    prepared it. You must expend a spell slot as normal. You regain
    this ability after taking a long rest.
  * You can use your Arcane Recovery every time you take a short rest.
